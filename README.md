# graphql-authentication-typescript
This project is a GraphQL-based authentication system that provides user registration, login, and two-factor authentication (2FA) capabilities. It is built using Node.js Typescript, MongoDB, GraphQL, and various libraries such as bcrypt for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for token-based authentication, speakeasy for two-factor authentication, and qrcode for generating QR codes.

# Features
User Registration: Users can register by providing their username, email, and password. The password is securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.

User Login: Registered users can log in using their email and password. The provided password is compared with the stored hashed password for authentication. Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and returned to the user.

JWT Token Authentication: User sessions are managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Tokens are generated upon registration and login and are used to authenticate subsequent API requests.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Users can enable 2FA for their accounts. A secret key is generated and associated with the user's account. A QR code containing the secret key is provided, which can be scanned by a 2FA app. Users must provide a one-time code generated by the 2FA app along with their password to log in.

Password Change: Users can change their password by providing their old password and a new password. The old password is verified, and if valid, the new password is securely hashed and updated in the database.

# Setup and Usage
Clone the repository and install dependencies using npm install.

Start the application using npm start. Access it at http://localhost:4000.

Use GraphQL queries and mutations to interact with the authentication system, such as registering users, logging in, enabling 2FA, and changing passwords.

For 2FA, scan the QR code using a compatible 2FA app and use the generated code for authentication.
